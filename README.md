# Keyword Out Of Context in Python

The goal of this project was to code a program that can generate a concordance from a text file, which is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a text file, listing every instance of each word with its immediate context (line and line number).

OBS: A version of this program also exists in C, located in [this repo](https://github.com/szeckirjr/KWOCinC).

# How to run the program

Use the following command on the terminal:
```./kwoc2.py [INPUT-FILE] (-e) [EXCEPTION-FILE]```
